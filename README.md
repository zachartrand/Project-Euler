# [Project-Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about)

This repository has my Python scripts solving the problems on Project Euler.

**Note**: This follows ProjectEuler's rules about sharing answers, as members
are allowed to share their answers for the first 100 problems. See here for
details: [Publishing solutions](https://projecteuler.net/about#publish).

The archives of the problems are here: [Problems Archives](https://projecteuler.net/archives)
